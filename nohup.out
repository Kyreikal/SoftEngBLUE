Matty! - Dad.\nMatty! Matty! Don\'t, don\'t move, okay? No, no, no! Just Don\'t move.\nSomebody get us some help! - Dad, what happened? - Matty, it\'s gonna be all right.\n- Just don\'t move.\nDon\'t move, okay? - What happened? (Man) Take it easy.\nYour boy He pushed me out of the way.\nHe saved my life.\n(Coughing) Oh, Dad! Oh, it burns! Oh, Jesus! Close your eyes, Matty.\n- Dad! - Close your eyes.\n- Dad! Dad! - Close your eyes.\nDad.\nDad.\nDad.\n(Stuttering) I can\'t see.\nI can\'t see.\nI can\'t see! I can\'t see! (Sirens approaching) I can\'t see! I can\'t see! (Matt) Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.\nIt\'s been, uh It\'s been too long since my last confession.\nMy dad, he used to come to this church back when I was a kid.\nHe was a fighter.\nOld school.\nBoxer.\nLost more than he won.\nHad a 24-31 record before he, uh But he could take a punch.\n- Jesus, he could take a punch.\n- Language.\nSorry, Father.\nYeah, guys he went up against used to say it was like hitting oak.\nAnd nights when he was outmatched, my dad\'s strategy was to let \'em hit him till they broke their hands.\n(Chuckles) He never got knocked out, my dad.\nKnocked down, sure.\nBut he, uh, always got back up.\nHe was always on his feet when he lost.\nEvery now and then, though, uh Every now and then, he\'d get hit and something inside of him would snap.\nMy grandmother, she was the real Catholic.\nFear of God ran deep.\nYou\'d have liked her.\nShe used to say, "Be careful of the Murdock boys.\nThey got the devil in \'em.\n" (Chuckles) And you\'d see it sometimes in the ring.\nHis eyes would go dead and he\'d start walking forward real slow hands at his sides, like he wasn\'t afraid of anything.\n(Sighs) And the other guy, he\'d see that look, and he\'d try to get away from him.\nNah.\nMy dad, he\'d catch him and trap him in the corner.\nLet the devil out.\nYeah.\nNow, I didn\'t understand it, you know? What he was feeling deep inside, I didn\'t understand it.\nNot back then.\nBut you understand it now? Perhaps this would be easier if you tell me what you\'ve done.\nI\'m not seeking penance for what I\'ve done, Father.\nI\'m asking forgiveness for what I\'m about to do.\nThat\'s not how this works.\nWhat exactly are you going to do? (Girl) Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! (Girls screaming) Hey! Hey! Man, shut up.\nI\'m getting $1,000 a head for y\'all.\nSo, you be quiet I let you have a bucket.\nYou don\'t - (Crackling) - (Screams) (Girls screaming) - (Man speaking Russian) - No! (Girl sobbing) No.\nPlease, no.\nScream all you want.\nCome on, let me hear you scream.\nScream loud.\n- (Girl) It\'s okay.\n- (Turk) Nobody gives a shit down here.\n(Laughing) (Screaming) (Grunts) (Man yelling) (Grunting) - (Bone cracking) - (Man screams) (Clicking) (Footsteps on freight container) (Grunts) - (Water splashing) - (Girls gasping) Head towards 48th.\nStay in the lights.\nFlag down the first officer you see.\n- Now! - (Girls screaming) (Grunting) (Automated female voice) Foggy, Foggy, Foggy.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- Foggy.\n(Beeps) Hello.\n(Foggy) Good morning, sunshine! - What time is it? - Half past get the hell up.\nLet\'s go.\nWe gotta meet - the real estate agent in 45.\n- (Groans) What was that? Was that a moan? - Do you have somebody in bed with you? - (Groans) The paralegal? Is it the para over at Never mind, I don\'t wanna hear about it.\nNo, I do wanna hear about it! What was she like? (Exhales sharply) Violent.\nI gotta get the blind thing going.\nIt\'s so unfair.\nOh, hey! Real estate agent, not your type.\nVery homely.\nMight be genetic.\nNo need to be charming.\nAnd she kinda told me she thinks blind people are "God\'s mistake.\n" That\'s a horrible thing to say, Foggy.\nI know! In this day and age? All right, shake it.\nI gotta go bribe a cop.\nAh, Foggy.\nKidding, NSA, if you\'re listening.\nBut seriously, yeah, I gotta go bribe a cop.\nOfficer of the law.\nDefense attorney.\nWe\'re supposed to be enemies.\nFirst off, we\'ve been enemies since we were four, Brett, so let\'s not blame it on career choices.\nSecondly, I\'m not a particularly good defense attorney, so helping me is like helping yourself.\nAnd finally, these are for Bess.\nPlease stop giving my mom cigars, Foggy.\nWhat? She\'ll outlive us all.\nLook, I\'m not asking you to do anything immoral.\nJust give me a heads up if something, you know, interesting walks through the door.\nYou\'re right.\nIt ain\'t the careers.\nThanks, buddy! (Sighs deeply) You\'ve got a reception area, a conference room and two offices.\nCorner suite has a view of the Hudson.\nYou can flip a coin with your partner for it.\nUh, he can have the view.\nI\'m so sorry.\nI didn\'t mean to - Of course not.\n- (Chuckles) Susan Harris.\nMidtown Property Solutions.\nMatt Murdock.\n(Chuckles) She just curtsied.\nIt was adorable.\nWell, it\'s nice to know chivalry isn\'t dead.\nSusan, would you mind walking me around the space? Of course.\nMy pleasure.\nAs I was telling your associate, this office was barely touched by the incident, which is why it\'s on the market already.\nThe neighbors weren\'t so lucky.\n"The incident"? Is that what we\'re calling it now? Well, it sounds so much better than "death and destruction raining from the sky, nearly wiping Hell\'s Kitchen off the map.\n" Shorter, too.\nOwner figuring in the delightful view of cranes and scaffolding? Feels like we\'re getting pre-incident prices.\nThey\'re a quarter of what they used to be.\nHell\'s Kitchen\'s on the rebound, Mr.\nNelson, and in 18 months, you won\'t be able to rent a broom closet at this price point.\nWe\'ll take it.\n(Chuckling) We will talk about it.\nBecause we\'re not sure we can afford even this palace, unless we make some changes to our current clientele policies.\nMy partner and I are having some disagreements over the direction of Nelson and Murdock.\nI believe we\'re here to defend the innocent.\nAnd I believe the innocent includes everyone not yet convicted of a crime.\nYou know, as the law states.\nHe tends to use fancy terminology.\nAnd my partner fails to recognize that, as defense attorneys, we\'re never gonna be able to keep the lights on, waiting on a horde of innocent souls to stumble into our loving arms.\nAt this point, I\'d settle for just one.\n(Shuddering breath) Drop the knife! - No, no, I didn\'t - Drop it! I didn\'t do this! I didn\'t I didn\'t do this! - Get on the ground! - I didn\'t do this! - Now! - Oh, God! (Sobbing) Oh, God! (Sobbing) No, I didn\'t do this.\nOh, God! I didn\'t do this! Oh, no! I didn\'t do this! (Cell phone ringing) (Chuckles) - Hey, buddy.\n- (Brett) Homicide.\nFemale suspect found at the scene.\nDefinitely qualifies as interesting.\nShe\'s been charged yet? Assistant DA hasn\'t made the call yet.\nDo you have a name on the suspect? Yeah.\nPage.\n- Karen Page.\n- (Door opening) Okay, can we please take the handcuffs off the 110-pound woman? Miss Page, can you tell me who these men are? We\'re her lawyers.\nUncuff our client and give us the room, please.\n(Karen sighs) Thank you, Detective.\n(Door lock buzzes) Miss Page, my name is Matt Murdock.\nThis is my associate, Foggy Nelson.\nDo you mind if we sit down? She gave a vague shrug.\nI say we go with it.\nWe understand you\'re in some trouble.\nWe, uh, may be able to help.\n(Foggy) Can you tell us what happened? Why don\'t we start with what we know, then? (Sighs) You were found in your apartment with one Daniel Fisher.\nWho appears to be the victim of a homicide, and currently, you\'re the only suspect, Miss Page.\nWho the hell are you guys? I\'m Matt.\nHe\'s Foggy.\nWho sent you? No one sent us.\nSo, what? You\'re just a couple of Good Samaritans? Today\'s just my lucky day? I bribed the desk sergeant with a box of cigars for his mom.\n(Matt) Our practice is relatively young, Miss Page, and we are aggressively pursuing new clientele.\nYou gotta stop giving Bess cigars.\nShe likes to smoke, Matt.\nIt\'s a free country.\nSo how long have you been practicing law? What time is it? It\'s 12:22 a.\nm.\nAbout seven hours.\n(Scoffs) Well, if you go from when we passed the bar I was going from when we got our own desks.\nOh, then, yeah.\nSeven hours.\nYou\'ve never done this before? If you were to hire us, then, yes, you would be our first client.\nTechnically.\nYeah.\nWell, I don\'t I don\'t have any money.\nWell, it was lovely to meet you, Miss Page.\n(Matt clearing throat) You don\'t have any money and we don\'t have any clients.\nMaybe we can help each other.\nTell me, how did you know Mr.\nFisher? We worked together.\n(Sighs) And your place of employment? Union Allied Construction.\nI\'m a secretary.\nDaniel worked downstairs in Legal.\n(Stuttering) I didn\'t know him very well.\nBut he was always nice, you know? But it\'s hard to meet people in the city, so I asked him if he would have a drink with me.\nYou asked him? (Voice breaking) Like I said, he was a nice guy.\nWe met at the Three Roads bar, on 49th Street.\nWe had a few drinks, and the next thing that I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment covered in blood.\nHis blood.\nNo, I\'m not stupid.\nI know how that sounds.\nBut I am telling you we met at the bar.\nWe had a few drinks.\nAnd I don\'t know what happened after that.\nIt wasn\'t me.\nPlease.\n(Heart beating steadily) Please, you have to believe me.\n(Sniffles) I didn\'t kill him.\nI believe you, Miss Page.\n(Sighs) There\'s plenty of room over there.\nDo you mind? 28,957.\nTell Rigoletto he\'ll get his money.\nMr.\nRigoletto has retired.\nHis books have been acquired by my employer.\nAh.\nWell, you tell him the same thing.\nI\'d like to show you something.\nDo you have a moment? What is it about college girls and Monet T-shirts? Open composition and the spontaneity reflecting this transformative time in their lives, perhaps? Or maybe they just like the color blue.\nCall her.\n(Line ringing) Hey, Dad, what\'s up? (Man) Hi, baby, I\'m just checking in.\nYou need anything? Uh, yeah, I actually have a ton of laundry.\nI was gonna swing by this weekend and use the machine.\nAnd then, maybe we could catch a movie after your shift? Yeah, yeah.\nThat\'d be great.\nUh, look Baby, I got I gotta go.\nI love you, baby.\nLove you, too.\nBye, Dad.\nNow, you see this man here? If we\'re being honest with each other, Mr.\nFarnum, I find his methods unpleasant.\nBut such are the times we live in.\nGive us a wave, Mr.\nRance.\nI told you that I will get you the money.\nSuch a small sum is of little interest to my employer.\nYour position, however, that\'s something we can work with.\n(Man sighs) What do you want me to do? I\'m friends with Gary Feinstein in the DA\'s office.\nI\'ll give him a call first thing in the morning, see where their heads are at.\nI\'m guessing they\'re gonna puff their chests, but they have to know murder two\'s a risk.\nWe end up at manslaughter, we get the right judge, - maybe she\'s out in five to 10 - We\'re not taking a deal.\nNo, this is why they have deals, Matt.\nSo the straightforward cases don\'t waste everybody\'s time.\nI don\'t think she did it.\nShe\'s the sole suspect, found at the scene, covered in blood, with the murder weapon and no defensive wounds.\nIf they offer anything it\'ll be a gift, and we will take that gift.\nWe do not want this to go to trial.\nThey don\'t want this to go to trial, either.\nWhy hasn\'t she been charged yet? They have 24 hours.\nAnd it\'s the weekend.\nThey\'re gonna take every last second to collect the evidence before they move.\nThey\'ve got the evidence.\nYou just laid it out yourself.\nThis is a good arrest, Foggy.\nWe should already be reading about it in the papers.\nThere\'s something not right about this case.\nI can feel it.\nYou can feel it? All right, I\'m just gonna say this once, and we can move on.\nYou don\'t necessarily show the best judgment when beautiful women are involved, Matt.\nHow would I even know if she\'s a beautiful woman? I don\'t know.\nIt\'s kinda spooky, actually.\nBut if there\'s a stunning woman with questionable character in the room, Matt Murdock\'s gonna find her and Foggy Nelson is gonna suffer.\n(Chuckling) All right, I don\'t disagree with anything you\'re saying.\n- Thank you.\n- But I need you to back me, anyway.\n(Groans) All right.\nFine.\nLet\'s start with the obvious, then.\nIf she didn\'t do it, who did? We\'re dead in the water if we don\'t give them an alternative.\nAgreed.\nWe need to take another run at our client.\nShe may not be guilty, Matt, but that doesn\'t mean Miss Page is telling the truth.\n(Muffled screaming) (Shrieks) (Cop grunting) (Gagging) (Panting) I\'m sorry.\nI\'m I\'m sorry.\n(Both grunting) (Screaming) (Cop groaning) (Panting) (Screaming) (Indistinct) I\'m gonna make this easy, Detectives.\nGet the ADA in here to release Miss Page and we\'ll recommend to our charming, media-friendly client that she not plaster the airwaves with how she was nearly killed in your custody.\nAnd I\'ll agree not to make cooing noises for the rest of this meeting when I think of the civil suit that we have on our hands.\nHow do you know they\'re not charging her? Besides the fact that you were required to do so four hours ago if you were gonna do it at all? That\'s an excellent question.\nAlong with how the security cameras on Miss Page\'s detention area went on the fritz right before the assault.\nYeah, we\'d like to speak to Mr.\nFarnum about that, as well as what Get in line.\nHe\'ll be arraigned in the morning.\nGet my client released.\nDon\'t make me ask again.\n(Whispering) I\'ll call the ADA.\nBut you take that tone with me again, I don\'t care if you\'re blind, I\'ll kick the shit out of you.\nReally? We\'re going there? (Scoffs) That was pleasant.\nIt doesn\'t make any sense.\nADA had everything they needed.\nUnless they had too much.\nWhat? What am I missing? Maybe someone else was in her apartment that night.\nMaybe they have evidence.\nThat\'s Brady material.\nThey\'d have to turn that over.\nOnly if she were charged.\nShe hangs herself in her cell, this all goes away.\n(Exhales sharply) Let\'s get her some clothes and get the hell out of here.\nCouldn\'t find any milk.\nI hope it\'s okay.\n(Matt) We have tea now? (Foggy) I stole it from the financial office next door.\n(Sighs) How are you holding up? Better.\nThanks for getting me out.\n(Foggy) Don\'t thank us yet.\nJust because they released you doesn\'t mean they won\'t eventually bring charges.\n(Matt) Which means it\'s crucial you don\'t speak to anyone other than the two of us about what happened.\nI don\'t have anyone to talk to, anyway.\nDo you have somewhere you can stay tonight? My apartment\'s not far.\nYou can\'t go back there.\nMiss Page, our immediate priority is to keep you safe.\nAnd in order to do that, we\'re gonna need to have a frank discussion.\nOkay.\nDo you know who\'s trying to kill you? No.\nDo you know why they\'re trying to kill you? Yes.\n- (Recording machine turns on) - (Karen) I, uh, work Worked in the financial department at Union Allied.\nThey\'re overseeing the bulk of the government contracts for the West Side reconstruction.\nI\'ve seen their signs all over Hell\'s Kitchen.\nThe last two years have transformed the business.\nThere\'s new owners, new grants, new contracts.\nYeah, the world watched half of New York get destroyed.\nThat\'s a lot of sympathy.\nAnd Union Allied benefited from every dollar of it.\nI was the secretary for the chief accountant.\nAnd one of my jobs was to coordinate the pension claims for the company.\nAbout a week ago, I was emailed a file called, "Pension Master.\n" It must have been meant for my boss, but I made the mistake of opening it.\nI\'m guessing it wasn\'t the pension fund.\nIt wasn\'t the size of the pension fund.\nI couldn\'t believe the numbers.\nBut it was still being designated as company pension.\nAnd it was constantly adjusted.\nMoney coming in and money going out.\n- Going where? - I don\'t know.\nIt was coded routing numbers, but we are talking a lot of money.\nWhat did you do with the file? Well, I told my boss, Mr.\nMcClintock, about it, and he laughed it off.\nHe said that it was a theoretical model that they were screwing around with.\nI knew something was wrong.\nI just I thought maybe it was just him, you know? Embezzling or whatever.\nSo, how did Daniel Fisher figure into this? Danny worked in the legal department.\nAnd I didn\'t know him very well.\nBut he was nice, so I asked him to meet me after work.\nI don\'t know how they knew.\nThey must have people watching me.\nThey must have people everywhere.\nAll I did was ask him for a drink.\nAnd I start to tell him about what I found and things got blurry.\nLike I was drugged.\nAnd the next thing I know, I wake up back in my apartment, covered in blood.\nThey killed him because of me.\nAnd he had a family.\nA little boy.\n- I need to get out of here.\nI\'m sorry.\n- We can\'t advise that, Miss Page.\nNo, you don\'t understand.\nEither you\'re with them or you\'re not.\nAnd if you\'re with them, then I\'m dead already.\nAnd if you are not, then I cannot have anybody else die because of me.\n- We can protect ourselves, Miss Page.\n- No, you can\'t.\nNot from them.\n- Miss Page - No.\n- We can\'t let you go home.\n- Please, just (Sobbing) She can stay with me.\nJust for tonight, until we figure something out.\nI\'ll keep you safe, Karen.\nI don\'t have much in the way of food, but there\'s a Thai place on the corner.\nIf we order now, it should get here by the time I make up the bedroom for you.\nIt\'s a little dark in here.\nI never Uh, light switch is on the wall to your left.\nSo, uh, (sighs) want some food? Uh, no, I\'m not Would you have a shirt I could borrow, maybe? This one\'s a little wet, and I\'m a Hellions fan.\n(Chuckles) Then don\'t tell Foggy.\nLet me grab something for you.\nAnd, really, I can\'t put you out of your bedroom.\nI\'ll be just fine on the couch.\nFrom what I understand about my living room, that might not be true.\nHoly shit! (Matt) Went up a year ago.\nI\'m told the co-op nearly rioted, some oversight from the developer\'s agreement.\nUpside is, nobody wanted it and I got a corner apartment at a hell of a discount.\nThanks.\nCan I ask a personal question? I haven\'t always been blind.\nI guess that\'s what everyone wants to know.\nThat or, "How do you comb your hair?" How do you comb your hair? Honestly, you just You hope for the best.\nThank you.\nYou wanna sit? How did it happen? Car accident.\nWhen I was nine.\nMust have been rough.\nNo.\nI made it through.\nDo you remember what it was like To To see? I, um Yes, I remember.\nI can\'t imagine what that must be like.\n(Chuckles) You know, I\'m supposed to say I don\'t miss it.\nThat\'s what they teach you in trauma recovery.\nDefine yourself by what you have, value the differences, make no apologies for what you lack.\nAnd it\'s all true, for the most part but it doesn\'t change the fact that I I\'d give anything to see the sky one more time.\nDo you mind if I ask you some questions now? Uh - Go ahead.\n- You just nodded, right? (Chuckles) Uh, yeah.\nOkay.\nHere\'s what I don\'t understand.\n(Clears throat) I\'m the man in charge of the pension funds and I find out one of my secretaries has discovered my illicit activity.\nTo make matters worse, she\'s now telling people about said activity.\nWhich, obviously, I can\'t have.\nSo I decide to take action.\nBut why don\'t I kill you? They tried.\nYeah, the second time.\nIn the jail.\nBut the first time, they left you alive.\nWhy? What were they trying to do? Frame you? Now, the second time, maybe that\'s a change of plan.\nSomething doesn\'t go their way, something sloppy at the crime scene.\nTwo lawyers show up out of the blue before their people can get to you.\nSo they figure, okay, maybe Karen hangs herself in her cell, and this thing gets swept under the rug.\nBut the first time The first time, they\'re not trying to kill you.\nThey\'re trying to discredit you.\nThey\'re trying to scare you.\nAnd the only reason that they would do that is if you have something that they want.\nSo, I\'ve been trying to think about what that could be, and the only thing I\'ve come up with (Heart beating) is the Union Allied pension file.\nDid you keep the file, Karen? (Beating grows faster) No.\nAs soon as I asked my boss about it, he took it away from me.\nThe IT guys, they came and they wiped the computers.\nBelieve me, a part of me wishes I\'d made a copy for myself but I guess I\'m just not that smart.\nAh, well, it was just a thought.\nIt\'s freezing this high up.\nNext time we\'re meeting at Per Se.\nI\'ll domesticate you boys yet.\nThis would be a balmy day in Samara, Leland.\nYes, it\'s perfect Chechnyans-kidnap- a-preschool weather, Vladimir.\n(Sighs) Can you at least pretend to be cold? It\'s unsettling.\n(Laughing) (Speaking Mandarin) Anyone here speak Chinese? Nobu? The man is Japanese.\nI know, I know.\nI just thought that Forget it.\n(Elevator door opens) Oh, please tell me he\'s right behind you.\nUnfortunately, my employer is attending to other matters.\nHe apologizes to you in particular, Madame Gao.\n(Speaking Russian) We do not deal with lap dogs.\nTell Mister We don\'t say his name.\nWoof, woof.\n(Man) He would like to know why you\'re short on the cargo totals.\nThere was a problem on the docks.\nBarrett and our men were attacked.\nSome moodak in a black mask.\n(Laughs) And you bought that? - (Speaking Russian) - (Leland) Okay, calm down.\nFine, we\'ll go with the man-in-black story.\nOur men would not lie.\nI said I\'m on board.\nI\'m glad to hear there\'s some new blood running around out there.\nHeroes and their consequences are why we have our current opportunities.\nNow can we review the latest numbers and Tell me more about this man.\nTook Barrett and our guys out while they were loading the container.\n(Speaking Mandarin) (Chuckles) She wants to know if this man stole the shipment for himself.\nNo.\nHe let the women go.\nHe took out your men.\nHow? Caught them by surprise.\nBeat them.\n- With his bare hands.\n- Four men with his bare hands? That is what we were told.\nPerhaps you should have been there yourself.\n(Scoffs) Again, I have to ask, why do we care? Every time one of these guys punches someone through a building, our margins go up 3%.\nWe should be celebrating.\nThis is different.\nMy employer will be displeased we\'re being inconvenienced by a lone vigilante.\nThen he should tell me to my face.\nThis is on you.\nDeal with it.\nQuietly.\nWe must be quiet, yes.\nWe would not want another Union Allied situation, would we? Big, loud, lot of questions.\nWe\'re handling it.\nLike you keep saying you\'re handling Prohaszka? We\'re in the process of negotiating with Mr.\nProhaszka.\nNegotiating? Maybe we handle our problem same way.\nSit down with this man in black, break bread.\nI think what Anatoly\'s trying to say is that it would be in our best interests for Union Allied to be tidied up as expeditiously as possible.\nAs I said we\'re handling it.\n(Thunder rumbling) (Door creaking) (Sniffles) (Breathing heavily) (Sighing) (Screaming) (Clicks) (Both yelling) - (Bones cracking) - Ahhh! (Straining) (Jack) Get up, Matty.\nHey.\nLet\'s go, finish up.\nI\'m tired, Dad.\nHey, I don\'t want you to end up like your old man.\nI never studied.\nLook where it got me.\nCome on, Matty.\nGet to work.\n(Both grunting) (Grunting) (Grunting) - (Bone cracking) - Ahhh! (Metal clinking) (Groaning) (Grunting) (Panting) (Groaning) Who What the hell? I\'ll get this into the right hands.\nNo, you can\'t.\nYou can\'t take it to the police.\nYou can\'t trust anyone.\nThen we tell everyone.\n(Breathing heavily) DNA evidence will put Rance at the murder scene.\nB and E gone sideways, his records altered in support.\nMr.\nFarnum\'s bail has been arranged for through the usual channels.\nLeland\'s to cover our exposure on the financials and McClintock takes the fall for Union Allied.\n(Man on phone) We can\'t have McClintock speaking to the authorities.\nPills.\nHe overdosed less than an hour ago.\nThe remaining concerns will be attended to shortly.\nRance was a professional.\nHow was he subdued? I\'m looking into it.\nWhat about the girl? Should I make the appropriate arrangements for her, along with the others? No.\nEverything she knows is already in the papers.\nHer lawyers, Nelson and Murdock.\nAmbulance chasers.\nThey\'re clean.\nStart a file.\nThey may be of use.\nUnderstood.\n- (Karen) Here you go.\n- (Both chuckling) - (Karen) So I know it\'s not much - (Matt) Hmm.\nin the way of repayment.\nBut it is, um, my grandmother\'s recipe, and she made me promise only to serve it to my future husband.\n(Matt chuckles) You know, it\'s, like, filled with virtue or something.\nI thought I detected a whiff of virtue in there.\nNot that I\'m complaining, but you really should be thanking the nut in the mask.\nHe\'s not a nut.\n- I mean, he\'s a little weird, maybe - We\'re just glad you\'re okay.\n(Foggy) Hear, hear! Well, if it weren\'t for you two, I\'d still be in that cell.\nHmm.\nJob\'s easy when your client\'s innocent.\nAll you did was tell the truth.\nYeah, but you listened.\nOh, and don\'t get us wrong, we\'re still gonna bill you.\nJust as soon as we figure out how to make bills.\n(Laughs) I did notice that you could use some help around here.\nAnd I owe you.\nMaybe I could clean the place up a bit.\nIs this place messy? Our firm is very prestigious and discerning, Miss Page.\nDo you have any prior experience hiding electrical cords (chuckling) up in ceiling tiles? Uh, no, but I\'ll work for free.\n- (Matt) Yeah, you\'re hired.\n- (Karen chuckles) (Foggy) You just got hired! You can leave the lights off.\n(Mouse clicking) - (Basket thuds) - (Girl screaming) (Matt grunting) Hey! Come on! Ahh! Daddy! Daddy! (Speaking Russian) No! Daddy! (Indistinct conversations) (Overlapping voices) (Boy) Daddy! Help! Daddy! (Boy screaming) \n\nRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=daredevil-2015&episode=s01e01',
